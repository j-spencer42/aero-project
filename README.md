# aero-project

This project is built as an extension of my academic pursuits while completing coursework for a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering at Utah State University. The idea is to create a useful program in the realm of aerodynamics that will help to increase my competence as both an engineer and a programmer. I'm also familiarizing myself more with Github and using git in general. Instructions on how and when to use this program will become available as the project develops.
